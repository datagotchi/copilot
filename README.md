# Datagotchi Copilot: The Stewardship Engine

### **Overview**
Datagotchi Copilot is the orchestration layer for the **7th Era of Value**. While previous eras focused on the extraction of behavioral data, this project prototypes a transition toward **Information Stewardship**. 

We are building a "Human-in-the-loop" (HITL) system designed to mitigate systemic fragility and prevent "Conquest Logic" from automating human agency out of the loop.

### **Design Philosophy**

As shown in our architectural framework, we prioritize:
* **Validation Gates:** Every LLM output is subjected to confidence checks and unit tests before reaching the human reviewer.
* **Metabolic Sovereignty:** Tools are designed to reduce "Evasion Risk" and cognitive load, ensuring the system serves the user’s intent rather than extractive algorithms.
* **Reliability & Risk Console:** Real-time monitoring of workflow completion and confidence scores to ensure high-integrity synthesis.

### **Failure Analysis & Governance**

True Stewardship requires visibility into system failure. Our **Structural AI Readiness Assessment** layer (pictured above) provides real-time monitoring of:

* **Systemic Drift:** Identifying when models begin to hallucinate or deviate from predictable outputs.
* **Cognitive Overload:** Monitoring the "Human Reviewer" stage to ensure the workload remains within the bounds of effective human agency.
* **Governance Provenance:** Tracking data from retrieval to inference to ensure transparency and explainability (XAI).

### **Technical R&D**
This repository serves as the R&D hub for:
1. **Affective-Neurofuturistic Sensemaking (ANS):** Designing interfaces that align with human neurobiology.
2. **Supervisory Control:** Applying David Woods' (OSU) principles of human-machine coordination to modern LLM agents.
3. **Synthesis Engines:** Leveraging structured prompt templates and automated validation to create "Public Utility" grade AI tools.
